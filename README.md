## Description
We conducted a preliminary investigation of the wine market by analyzing online consumer purchasing behavior through competitor operations. Our analysis focuses on wine features (type, country, year, ABV), price (75cL bottle), and reviews (number and scores) gathered from competitor websites. Key objectives include identifying popular wines and their features, as well as frequent price ranges to understand product portfolios and business focus. Data collection was facilitated using Python libraries BeautifulSoup and Selenium. Exploratory data analysis and visualisation was performed using Python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn.

As part of data cleaning missing values in the dataset were addressed and outliers handled. Feature engineering was done to improve the saliency of the features in the dataset, like calculating the age of the wine, one hot ecoding of categorical variables, scoring of user ratings, scaling of prices based on quantities, de-skewing price values as log-price and creating country codes.

Exploratory analysis and Visualisation was done to gain insights into the wine market such as price ranges and categories, most popular countries of origin, most popular ABV (alcohol content) categories by retailer, most popular ages of wine and most popular wine types.
